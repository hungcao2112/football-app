## 5. Issues 

The assignment is quite challenging since there're somes technical requirements that I'm not really familiar with like Combine, Core Data or UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource. But the most challenging technical issue that I've faced in this project is using CoreData

But it's always fun to learn something new :D I've started searching for its documentations, create some sample projects to implement it in the most easy way, try to understand how it works. And finally, I can implement it in this project but in a normal approach

Then, I have to combine the CoreData with Combine framework, tried to create some custom Publishers and Subscribers to make it work, the final result not the best way I think but it's the best I can do for now

This experience helped me learn a lot about CoreData, about its managed objects or the parent-child context. Althought CoreData is too complicated to implement and maintaince for me now, but I will see what can I do with it in the future
